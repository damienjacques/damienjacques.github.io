        <h4 class="first_small"> Smartpop: Dynamic population mapping using mobile phone data in Belgium. 2018 </h4>

        <p>The objectives of the research <a href="http://www.smartpop.be/">SmartPop project</a> were to develop land use and land cover mapping tools, as well as reliable and accurate population maps to analyze and predict the development of urban areas and the population spatial distribution. In this context, I was in charge of conducting a study of the potential of a mobile phone dataset for the cartography of population dynamics in Belgium. It is also for this project that I developed my first shiny applications.</p>

                    <p> In case of disaster or hazard exposure, the efficiency of the emergency response depends on the availability of up-to-date information on the dynamics of the affected population. Residential population, obtained from the National Register in Belgium, provides only partial information as it only reflects the population distribution at night. Furthermore, there are obvious limitations to this estimation: the legal residence is not necessarily the equivalent of the living place (student accommodation, second residence), people are not always at home during night-time (outings) and non-Belgian population (tourists, international workers. . . ) is not covered. More importantly, it only provides a static representation of the population density, while completely missing its dynamic features. Yet the difference between night-time and day-time population can be dramatic. For instance, it has been shown that the population of Manhattan nearly doubled between night and day due to commuters and visitors. For these reasons, there is a substantial need to explore the potential of unconventional information sources such as the Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), to provide complementary information of population dynamic than the one given by official statistics.</p>

                    <p>No technology has ever spread faster around the world than the mobile phone. In two decades, the number of mobile phone subscriptions has increased at a tremendous speed and is now equivalent to the current world population. Each time a call is made (or an SMS sent), a Call Detail Record (CDR) is generated by the telecom companies for billing purpose. These metadata can provide information on when, how and from where (from which antenna) we communicate making them an interesting asset for dynamic population
                        mapping.</p>

                    <p>Based on 1 year of CDRs (May 2014 – April 2015) from a main Belgian provider (Mobistar – Orange), we explored the potential of mobile phone metadata to dynamically map the population in Belgium. The data provide the number of Belgian SIM cards, aggregated per hour, that were active (made a call or sent an SMS) in the area covered by ~4000 antennas in Belgium. We used the state-of-the-art log-log linear regression model to estimate the residential population density using the night-time SIM density during working days.</p>

                    <p>After extensive data cleaning and aggregation, we were able to confirm the potential of mobile phone data for population mapping (Pearson correlation up to >0.9). However, without appropriate validation data, we were unable to calibrate a model for the estimation of the daytime population. For demonstration purposes, proof-of-concept dynamic maps were produced to illustrate the impact of mobility on risk exposure</p>

        <h4> Social capital and transaction costs in millet markets. Data For Development (D4D) Senegal. 2014-2015 </h4>

        <p>&lsquo;<a href="http://www.d4d.orange.com/en/Accueil" target="_blank">Data for Development Senegal</a>&rsquo; was an open innovation challenge on Big Data with a focus on applications for social good. Sonatel (Orange branch in Senegal) provided international research laboratories with anonymous data extracted from mobile communications in Senegal. Five priority topics were defined, for which needs were expressed in collaboration with the responsible ministries or partner institutions: Health, Agriculture, Transport/Urban Planning, Energy, National Statistics. The results of the challenge were presented at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a> during the <a href="http://netmob.org/www15/index.html" target="_blank">Netmob Conference</a> in April 2015.</p>

        <p>For this challenge, my team and I were awarded the <a href="https://www.ucad.sn/files/D4D%20Challenge%20Senegal%20Appendix%201%20-%20list%20of%20winners.pdf" target="_blank">Agriculture Prize</a> for our project &lsquo;<a href="https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/en/object/boreal%3A174338/datastream/PDF_01/view" target="_blank">Genesis of millet prices in Senegal: the role of production, markets and their failures</a>&rsquo; (later published as &lsquo;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844017328396" target="_blank">Social capital and transaction costs in millet markets</a>&rsquo;).

                    <p> In sub-Saharan Africa, transaction costs are believed to be the most significant barrier that prevents smallholders and farmers from gaining access to markets and productive assets. In this study, we explore the impact of social capital on millet prices for three contrasted years in Senegal. Social capital is approximated using a unique data set on mobile phone communications between 9 million people allowing to simulate the business network between economic agents. Our approach is a spatial equilibrium model that integrates a diversified set of data. Local supply and demand were respectively derived from remotely sensed imagery and population density maps. The road network was used to establish market catchment areas, and transportation costs were derived from distances between markets. Results demonstrate that accounting for the social capital in the transaction costs explained 1–9% of the price variance depending on the year. The year-specific effect remains challenging to assess but could be related to a strengthening of risk aversion following a poor harvest.

        <h4> Harnessing the Data Revolution for Food Security and Poverty Mapping: synergies between Mobile Phone Data, Earth Observation and Official Statistics in Senegal. Ph.D. Thesis. 2013-2018. </h4>

        <p>I did my PhD thesis in bioengineering and agronomy in the Geomatics lab of the catholic University of Louvain, under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Defourny. Below is a short abstract.</p>

        <p>Relevant, accurate and timely data are needed to track progress towards the SDGs, hold political leaders accountable and promote sustainable development. Yet, current data used for official statistics in developing countries are unreliable, outdated and expensive to collect. The thesis aims to bridge this knowledge gap by harnessing the unique features of Earth Observation and mobile phone data to develop and test new methods that can supplement official stats for food security and poverty mapping in Senegal. </p>

                    <p> Relevant, accurate and timely data are needed to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, hold political leaders accountable and promote sustainable development. Yet, current data used for official statistics in developing countries are unreliable, outdated and expensive to collect. This thesis aims to bridge the resulting knowledge gap by harnessing the unique features of Earth observation and mobile phone data to develop and test new methods that can supplement official statistics for food security and poverty mapping in Senegal. First, we developed a methodological framework to define the accuracy requirements for early estimators of cropland area, crop area and crop yield needed to support early warning systems for food security. We showed that the inter-annual variability of crop yield was the main factor limiting the accuracy of pre-harvest production estimates. Second, we demonstrated how to integrate into a spatial equilibrium model a unique data set of mobile phone communications between 9 million people to model the impact of the traders’ social capital on market functioning and millet prices, an important indicator of food access. Finally, we developed a computational framework to efficiently combine disparate data sources, such as mobile phone and Earth observation data, to provide more accurate predictions of poverty and its determinants for fine spatial micro-regions. A key element of the proposed approach is that data can remain behind the firewall of the data suppliers, therefore ensuring that the privacy of mobile phone users is preserved. The thesis also contributes towards a better understanding of the potential and limitations of the data revolution to support the achievement of main development goals.
