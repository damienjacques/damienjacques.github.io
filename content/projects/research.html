    <h4> Data For Development Senegal. 2015 </h4>



    <p>&lsquo;<a href="http://www.d4d.orange.com/en/Accueil" target="_blank">Data for Development Senegal</a>&rsquo; was an open innovation challenge on Big Data with a focus on applications for social good. Sonatel (Orange branch in Senegal) provided international research laboratories with anonymous data extracted from mobile communications in Senegal. Five priorityFive priority topics were defined, for which needs were expressed in collaboration with the responsible ministries or partner institutions: Health, Agriculture, Transport/Urban Planning, Energy, National Statistics. The results of the challenge were presented at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a> during the <a href="http://netmob.org/www15/index.html" target="_blank">Netmob Conference</a> in April 2015.</p>

    <p>For this challenge, my team and I were awarded the <a href="http://d4d.orange.com/content/download/43330/405662/version/3/file/D4Dchallenge_leaflet_A4_V2Eweblite.pdf" target="_blank">Agriculture Prize</a> for our project &lsquo;<a href="https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/en/object/boreal%3A174338/datastream/PDF_01/view" target="_blank">Genesis of millet prices in Senegal: the role of production, markets and their failures</a>&rsquo; (later published as &lsquo;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844017328396" target="_blank">Social capital and transaction costs in millet markets</a>&rsquo;).

                <h4>Research Abstract</h4>

                <p> In sub-Saharan Africa, transaction costs are believed to be the most significant barrier that prevents smallholders and farmers from gaining access to markets and productive assets. In this study, we explore the impact of social capital on millet prices for three contrasted years in Senegal. Social capital is approximated using a unique data set on mobile phone communications between 9 million people allowing to simulate the business network between economic agents. Our approach is a spatial equilibrium model that integrates a diversified set of data. Local supply and demand were respectively derived from remotely sensed imagery and population density maps. The road network was used to establish market catchment areas, and transportation costs were derived from distances between markets. Results demonstrate that accounting for the social capital in the transaction costs explained 1–9% of the price variance depending on the year. The year-specific effect remains challenging to assess but could be related to a strengthening of risk aversion following a poor harvest.

            <h4>Research Abstract</h4>

            <p> Relevant, accurate and timely data are needed to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, hold political leaders accountable and promote sustainable development. Yet, current data used for official statistics in developing countries are unreliable, outdated and expensive to collect. This thesis aims to bridge the resulting knowledge gap by harnessing the unique features of Earth observation and mobile phone data to develop and test new methods that can supplement official statistics for food security and poverty mapping in Senegal. First, we developed a methodological framework to define the accuracy requirements for early estimators of cropland area, crop area and crop yield needed to support early warning systems for food security. We showed that the inter-annual variability of crop yield was the main factor limiting the accuracy of pre-harvest production estimates. Second, we demonstrated how to integrate into a spatial equilibrium model a unique data set of mobile phone communications between 9 million people to model the impact of the traders’ social capital on market functioning and millet prices, an important indicator of food access. Finally, we developed a computational framework to efficiently combine disparate data sources, such as mobile phone and Earth observation data, to provide more accurate predictions of poverty and its determinants for fine spatial micro-regions. A key element of the proposed approach is that data can remain behind the firewall of the data suppliers, therefore ensuring that the privacy of mobile phone users is preserved. The thesis also contributes towards a better understanding of the potential and limitations of the data revolution to support the achievement of main development goals.
