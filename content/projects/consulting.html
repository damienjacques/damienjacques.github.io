    <h4 class="first_small"> Mapping poverty over time in a post-crisis setting using mobile phone data in Nicaragua. 2019 </h4>

    <p>I was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en">Inter-American Development Bank</a> to carry out a study on the 2018 socio-economic crisis in Nicaragua and its impact on poverty. To do so, I had access to a rich database from Telefonica with a series of indicators generated from the mobile phone activity of users in the country before and after the crisis.</p>

                <p> On April 18, 2018, a sociopolitical crisis started in Nicaragua following protests against social security reforms that increased taxes and cut into benefits. The resulting economic impact of the crisis was reported as particularly devastating. However, no accurate data covering the whole country at fine granularity is available to date to assess the scale of this impact. In particular, very little data exists to estimate the number of people who have fallen below the poverty line as a result of the crisis.</p>

                <p>Poverty is traditionally estimated from national household surveys which are expensive, labour intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, poverty maps are generally available at low frequency and only representative at coarse granularity. On the other hand, non-traditional data sources such as mobile phone data have demonstrated great potential for estimating poverty at low cost, more frequently and at high resolution. Their continuous and almost real-time availability makes them an interesting asset for crisis monitoring. However, although the potential exists in theory, it has yet to be empirically proven. By studying the variability of mobile phone data before and after the Nicaraguan crisis, this study aims to assess the value of these data for tracking a temporal decline in socio-economic and poverty indicators and provide first quantitative estimates of the impact of the crisis over time.

    <h4> Decision making app in financial inclusion and epidemiology in Brazil. 2019 </h4>

    <p> <a href="https://www.experian.com/big-data/datalabs">Experian DataLab</a> Brazil has partnered with Dalberg Data Insights to pilot an online marketplace aiming to bring together the different actors of data innovation for social good (data analysts, data providers, funders, problem owners...).</p>

    <p> In this project I participated in the development of two case study applications. Finapp is a toolbox to design the best strategy for increasing financial inclusion in a country. It provides a series of tools for the visualization and analysis of spatialized financial inclusion data. I developed this app from A to Z, from conception, through design and implementation. Disease app is an epidemiological disease modeling application for which I developed the front end. Finally, I also participated in the design of the market place itself (preliminary design and front-end contribution).</p>

    <h4> Agriculural Information System System in Burkina Faso. 2019 </h4>

    <p> Dalberg Data Insights proposed a case study to <a href="https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html">GIZ</a>, the German cooperation agency, to demonstrate the use of their internal data in use cases that leverage artificial intelligence. In this case, the project was to develop an information system on the cashew crop in Burkina Faso using Sentinel-2 satellite images. This starting point served to lay the foundations for a more ambitious strategy on the governance of training data available at GIZ. </p>

    <p> I led this project from A to Z, from the business development to the delivery of the final products, including the technical management of the project and the design of the scale-up. </p>

    <h4> Poverty Mapping Initiative. 2019 </h4>

    <p> Dalberg Data Insights, the Qatar Computing Research Institute and the World Bank Group convened experts to join a Poverty Mapping workshop at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 2019 AI for Good Global Summit to kick-off a poverty mapping iniative. The goal of the workshop was to share knowledge and make plans to better combine traditional development data (such as household surveys, labor force surveys and censuses) with complementary sources of big data (satellite, mobile phones, social media) towards achieving more accurate, timely and cost-effective measures of poverty.

                <p> About one-tenth of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty (World Bank, 2018). The goal to “eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030” tops the list of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders, at the United Nations summit in September 2015. Regardless of the nature of the strategies used to reduce poverty, governments and development agencies need a baseline depiction. Poverty maps provide such a spatial distribution of the socio-economic deprivations and help policy makers assess the impact of interventions. </p>

                <p> Poverty is traditionally estimated from national household surveys which are (i) expensive (~USD 1M), (ii) labour intensive and (iii) time-consuming (~12 to 20 months to complete). Consequently, poverty maps are generally available at low frequency (every 5 to 10+ years) and only representative at coarse granularity. For instance, between 2002 and 2011, among the 155 countries for which the World Bank monitors poverty data, 57 have only one or zero poverty data point available (Serajuddin, 2015).</p>

                <p> On the other hand, non-traditional data sources such as mobile phone data (Blumenstock et al., 2015), satellite data (Jean et al., 2016, Engstrom et al., 2014) and social media data have demonstrated great potential for estimating poverty at low cost, more frequently and at high resolution. A few studies have also explored the combination of different data sources (in particular, mobile phone and satellite data) for poverty mapping, showing improved accuracy using complementary data sources (Njuguna et al., 2017, Steele et al., 2017 and Pokhriyal et al., 2017). However, there are still significant technical (bias, accuracy), practical (training data availability, data access) and ethical (individual and group privacy) challenges preventing the successful operationalization of these methods.</p>
