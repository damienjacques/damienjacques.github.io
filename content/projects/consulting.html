    <h4 class="first_small"> Predictive modeling for debt recovery. Microfund for Women. 2024 </h4>
    This work focuses on improving debt collection strategies through a data-driven approach to enhance efficiency, recovery rates, and resource allocation. I identified patterns of delinquency and developed a statistical model to predict delinquency risks. By analyzing key factors like payment delays, partial repayments, and past repayment behavior, I tailored collection strategies to different stages of delinquency. These insights inform a dual strategy: continuing existing efforts in cases with high recovery likelihood and prioritizing intervention where recovery chances are marginal. This framework aims to refine decision-making processes, optimize resources, and improve debt recovery outcomes.

    This work focuses on enhancing customer segmentation in digital financial services to improve user experience and marketing strategies. By analyzing customer transactional patterns, I identified key customer groups—inactive, established, newcomers, and churned—to with proposal for targeted financial products and marketing efforts. My goal was to understand distinct customer personas and behaviors, such as the needs of long-term users, the engagement patterns of new customers, and the reasons behind churn. Using data-driven insights, I applied a two-step approach: hypothesizing customer personas and applying quantitative metrics to refine segmentation. This ensures personalized lending solutions and more effective customer engagement.

    <h4 class="first_small"> Mapping poverty over time in a post-crisis setting using mobile phone data in Nicaragua. Inter-American Development Bank. 2019 </h4>

    <p>I was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en">Inter-American Development Bank</a> to study the 2018 socio-economic crisis in Nicaragua and its impact on poverty. The analysis leveraged a rich dataset from Telefonica, which provided indicators from mobile phone activity before and after the crisis.</p>

                <p> In April 2018, Nicaragua faced a sociopolitical crisis following protests against social security reforms, leading to widespread economic damage. However, no comprehensive, high-resolution data exists to fully capture the crisis's impact, particularly on poverty levels.</p>

                <p>Traditional methods of measuring poverty, like household surveys, are costly, time-consuming, and often lack granularity. Mobile phone data, on the other hand, offers a low-cost, real-time alternative with the potential to track socio-economic changes in finer detail. This study examines how mobile phone data can be used to monitor poverty indicators and provide quantitative estimates of the crisis's long-term effects. Unfortunately, the results remain confidential.

    <h4> Agriculural Information System in Burkina Faso. GIZ. 2019 </h4>

    <p> Dalberg Data Insights partnered with <a href="https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html">GIZ</a>, the German cooperation agency, to demonstrate the use of their internal data in use cases that leverage artificial intelligence. In this case, the project was to develop an information system on the cashew crop in Burkina Faso using Sentinel-2 satellite images. This starting point served to lay the foundations for a more ambitious strategy on the governance of training data available at GIZ. </p>

    <p> I led this project end-to-end, from business development to the final product delivery, including technical project management and designing the scale-up strategy. </p>

    <h4> Poverty Mapping Initiative. DDI, QCRI, World Bank. 2019 </h4>

    <p> Dalberg Data Insights, the Qatar Computing Research Institute, and the World Bank Group brought together experts for a Poverty Mapping workshop during the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 2019 AI for Good Global Summit to launch a poverty mapping initiative. The workshop aimed to share knowledge and plan how to combine traditional development data (such as household surveys, labor force surveys, and censuses) with big data sources (satellite, mobile phones, social media) to achieve more accurate, timely, and cost-effective poverty measurements. I led the organization of this project in collaboration with my partners at the Qatar Computing Research Institute. </p>

                <p> About one-tenth of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty (World Bank, 2018). The goal to “eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030” tops the list of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders, at the United Nations summit in September 2015. Regardless of the nature of the strategies used to reduce poverty, governments and development agencies need a baseline depiction. Poverty maps provide such a spatial distribution of the socio-economic deprivations and help policy makers assess the impact of interventions. </p>

                <p> Poverty is traditionally estimated from national household surveys which are (i) expensive (~USD 1M), (ii) labour intensive and (iii) time-consuming (~12 to 20 months to complete). Consequently, poverty maps are generally available at low frequency (every 5 to 10+ years) and only representative at coarse granularity. For instance, between 2002 and 2011, among the 155 countries for which the World Bank monitors poverty data, 57 have only one or zero poverty data point available (Serajuddin, 2015).</p>

                <p> On the other hand, non-traditional data sources such as mobile phone data (Blumenstock et al., 2015), satellite data (Jean et al., 2016, Engstrom et al., 2014) and social media data have demonstrated great potential for estimating poverty at low cost, more frequently and at high resolution. A few studies have also explored the combination of different data sources (in particular, mobile phone and satellite data) for poverty mapping, showing improved accuracy using complementary data sources (Njuguna et al., 2017, Steele et al., 2017 and Pokhriyal et al., 2017). However, there are still significant technical (bias, accuracy), practical (training data availability, data access) and ethical (individual and group privacy) challenges preventing the successful operationalization of these methods.</p>
