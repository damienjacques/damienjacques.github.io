    <h4 class="first_small"> Mapping poverty over time in a post-crisis setting using mobile phone data in Nicaragua. 2019 </h4>

    <p>I was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en">Inter-American Development Bank</a> to study the 2018 socio-economic crisis in Nicaragua and its impact on poverty. The analysis leveraged a rich dataset from Telefonica, which provided indicators from mobile phone activity before and after the crisis.</p>

                <p> In April 2018, Nicaragua faced a sociopolitical crisis following protests against social security reforms, leading to widespread economic damage. However, no comprehensive, high-resolution data exists to fully capture the crisis's impact, particularly on poverty levels.</p>

                <p>Traditional methods of measuring poverty, like household surveys, are costly, time-consuming, and often lack granularity. Mobile phone data, on the other hand, offers a low-cost, real-time alternative with the potential to track socio-economic changes in finer detail. This study examines how mobile phone data can be used to monitor poverty indicators and provide quantitative estimates of the crisis's long-term effects. Unfortunately, the results remain confidential.

                <p>The results are (unfortunately) confidential.

    <h4> Decision-making app for financial inclusion and epidemiology in Brazil. 2019 </h4>

    <p> <a href="https://www.experian.com/big-data/datalabs">Experian DataLab</a> Brazil, in collaboration with Dalberg Data Insights, launched an online marketplace to connect key players in data innovation for social good.</p>

    <p> I contributed to two case study applications:
        <ul>
            <li>FinApp: A toolbox designed to help increase financial inclusion by visualizing and analyzing spatialized financial data. I led the development from concept through design and implementation.</li>
            <li>Disease App: An epidemiological modeling tool for which I developed the front-end interface.</li>
        </ul> 
    Additionally, I played a role in the marketplace's initial design and front-end development.</p>

    <h4> Agriculural Information System in Burkina Faso. 2019 </h4>

    <p> Dalberg Data Insights partnered with <a href="https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html">GIZ</a>, the German cooperation agency, to demonstrate the use of their internal data in use cases that leverage artificial intelligence. In this case, the project was to develop an information system on the cashew crop in Burkina Faso using Sentinel-2 satellite images. This starting point served to lay the foundations for a more ambitious strategy on the governance of training data available at GIZ. </p>

    <p> I led this project end-to-end, from business development to the final product delivery, including technical project management and designing the scale-up strategy. </p>

    <h4> Poverty Mapping Initiative. 2019 </h4>

    <p> Dalberg Data Insights, the Qatar Computing Research Institute, and the World Bank Group brought together experts for a Poverty Mapping workshop during the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 2019 AI for Good Global Summit to launch a poverty mapping initiative. The workshop aimed to share knowledge and plan how to combine traditional development data (such as household surveys, labor force surveys, and censuses) with big data sources (satellite, mobile phones, social media) to achieve more accurate, timely, and cost-effective poverty measurements. I led the organization of this project in collaboration with my partners at the Qatar Computing Research Institute. </p>

                <p> About one-tenth of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty (World Bank, 2018). The goal to “eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030” tops the list of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders, at the United Nations summit in September 2015. Regardless of the nature of the strategies used to reduce poverty, governments and development agencies need a baseline depiction. Poverty maps provide such a spatial distribution of the socio-economic deprivations and help policy makers assess the impact of interventions. </p>

                <p> Poverty is traditionally estimated from national household surveys which are (i) expensive (~USD 1M), (ii) labour intensive and (iii) time-consuming (~12 to 20 months to complete). Consequently, poverty maps are generally available at low frequency (every 5 to 10+ years) and only representative at coarse granularity. For instance, between 2002 and 2011, among the 155 countries for which the World Bank monitors poverty data, 57 have only one or zero poverty data point available (Serajuddin, 2015).</p>

                <p> On the other hand, non-traditional data sources such as mobile phone data (Blumenstock et al., 2015), satellite data (Jean et al., 2016, Engstrom et al., 2014) and social media data have demonstrated great potential for estimating poverty at low cost, more frequently and at high resolution. A few studies have also explored the combination of different data sources (in particular, mobile phone and satellite data) for poverty mapping, showing improved accuracy using complementary data sources (Njuguna et al., 2017, Steele et al., 2017 and Pokhriyal et al., 2017). However, there are still significant technical (bias, accuracy), practical (training data availability, data access) and ethical (individual and group privacy) challenges preventing the successful operationalization of these methods.</p>

    <p> I co-developed this training program, focusing on remote sensing, spatial data analytics, GIS, and data visualization.
