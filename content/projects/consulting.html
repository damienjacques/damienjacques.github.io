    <h4 class="first_small"> Smartpop: Dynamic population mapping using mobile phone data. 2018 </h4>

    <p>The objectives of the research <a href="http://www.smartpop.be/">SmartPop project</a> were to develop land use and land cover mapping tools, as well as distribution maps of the reliable and accurate population to analyze and predict the development of urban areas and the population distribution. In this context, I was in charge of conducting the study of the potential of a mobile phone dataset for the cartography of population dynamics in Belgium. It is also for this project that I developed my first shiny applications.</p>

                <p> In case of disaster or hazard exposure, the efficiency of the emergency response depends on the availability of up-to-date information on the dynamics of the affected population. Residential population, obtained from the National Register in Belgium, provides only partial information as it only reflects the population distribution at night. Furthermore, there are obvious limitations to this estimation: the legal residence is not necessarily the equivalent of the living place (student accommodation, second residence), people are not always at home during night-time (outings) and non-Belgian population (tourists, international workers. . . ) is not covered. More importantly, it only provides a static representation of the population density, while completely missing its dynamic features. Yet the difference between night-time and day-time population can be dramatic. For instance, it has been shown that the population of Manhattan nearly doubled between night and day due to commuters and visitors. For these reasons, there is a substantial need to explore the potential of unconventional information sources such as the Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), to provide complementary information of population dynamic than the one given by official statistics.</p>

                <p>No technology has ever spread faster around the world than the mobile phone. In two decades, the number of mobile phone subscriptions has increased at a tremendous speed and is now equivalent to the current world population. Each time a call is made (or an SMS sent), a Call Detail Record (CDR) is generated by the telecom companies for billing purpose. These metadata can provide information on when, how and from where (from which antenna) we communicate making them an interesting asset for dynamic population
                    mapping.</p>

                <p>Based on 1 year of CDRs (May 2014 – April 2015) from a main Belgian provider (Mobistar – Orange), we explored the potential of mobile phone metadata to dynamically map the population in Belgium. The data provide the number of Belgian SIM cards, aggregated per hour, that were active (made a call or sent an SMS) in the area covered by ~4000 antennas in Belgium. We used the state-of-the-art log-log linear regression model to estimate the residential population density using the night-time SIM density during working days.</p>

                <p>After extensive data cleaning and aggregation, we were able to confirm the potential of mobile phone data for population mapping (Pearson correlation up to >0.9). However, without appropriate validation data, we were unable to calibrate a model for the estimation of the daytime population. For demonstration purposes, proof-of-concept dynamic maps were produced to illustrate the impact of mobility on risk exposure</p>
