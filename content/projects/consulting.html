    <h4 class="first_small"> Mapping poverty over time in a post-crisis setting using mobile phone data in Nicaragua. 2019 </h4>

    <p>I was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en">Inter-American Development Bank</a> to carry out a study on the 2018 socio-economic crisis in Nicaragua and its impact on poverty. To do so, I had access to a rich database from Telefonica with a series of indicators generated from the mobile phone activity of users in the country before and after the crisis.</p>

                <p> On April 18, 2018, a sociopolitical crisis started in Nicaragua following protests against social security reforms that increased taxes and cut into benefits. The resulting economic impact of the crisis was reported as particularly devastating. However, no accurate data covering the whole country at fine granularity is available to date to assess the scale of this impact. In particular, very little data exists to estimate the number of people who have fallen below the poverty line as a result of the crisis.</p>

                <p>Poverty is traditionally estimated from national household surveys which are expensive, labour intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, poverty maps are generally available at low frequency and only representative at coarse granularity. On the other hand, non-traditional data sources such as mobile phone data have demonstrated great potential for estimating poverty at low cost, more frequently and at high resolution. Their continuous and almost real-time availability makes them an interesting asset for crisis monitoring. However, although the potential exists in theory, it has yet to be empirically proven. By studying the variability of mobile phone data before and after the Nicaraguan crisis, this study aims to assess the value of these data for tracking a temporal decline in socio-economic and poverty indicators and provide first quantitative estimates of the impact of the crisis over time.

    <h4> Decision making app in financial inclusion and epidemiolgy in Brazil. 2019 </h4>

    <p> <a href="https://www.experian.com/big-data/datalabs">Experian DataLab</a> Brazil has partnered with Dalberg Data Insights to pilot an online marketplace aiming to bring together the different actors of data innovation for social good (data analysts, data providers, funders, problem owners...).</p>

    <p> In this project I participated in the development of two case study applications. Finapp is a toolbox to design the best strategy for increasing financial inclusion in a country. It provides a series of tools for the visualization and analysis of spatialized financial inclusion data. I developed this app from A to Z, from conception, through design and implementation. Disease app is an epidemiological disease modeling application for which I developed the front end. Finally, I also participated in the design of the market place itself (preliminary design and front-end contribution).</p>
